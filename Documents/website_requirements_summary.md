**Note on discrepancy:** The provided PDF heavily emphasizes fitness industry construction, while the initial description from the user is broader (residential and commercial projects). This will need to be addressed in the website content to ensure accuracy and avoid misrepresentation. I will prioritize the user's initial description for the overall website scope, but incorporate the fitness industry expertise as a specialized service or highlight it as a key strength if appropriate.
