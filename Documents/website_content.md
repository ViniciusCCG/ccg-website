When you try and describe that Australian trade/builder who puts clients first, doesn't cut corners, has the attention to detail on every minor detail of your prized possession and simply is that guy you know is genuine, well you have just described Steve!"

### Client Reviews Section
**Headline**: Client Success Stories

**Carl Travers - Anytime Fitness Franchisee**
"As an owner of 20+ Anytime Fitness gymnasiums I have had my fair share of builders who initially have a good fair work relationship with high quality finishes which over time the variations and agreements have various line items removed! It is actually sad to think that loyalty and continued business with a builder or brand can quickly become an expectation and it is now your job as the customer to start questioning the service you thought was a given. This is NOT Collaborative Construction! As an ex special forces sniper I think I can call a spade a spade! When I first met Steve he had me at hello! Now 8+ builds later in record time he has delivered every single time and with prices which simply can't be beaten!"
